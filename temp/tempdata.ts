Mandela's unique way of handling the challenges of life range from his relationship with the British Royals and the attempted suicide of a South African rugby hero, to epic political strategies that clinched a World Cup, and single-handedly averted civil war. Beyond the media hype was the political genius who could manipulate the press, inspire awe in celebrities, politicians and superstars alike and managed to shape a country from inside a prison cell. For the first time, his genius as a political strategist is laid bare and we discover the seminal moments that transformed a man into a hero.",

Hoffman shows an obvious distaste for money politics and the conservative right. He looks seedier and more disillusioned the campaign progresses. Eventually Hoffman seems most energized by the Ralph Nader campaign as an alternative to the nearly indistinguishable major parties. The high point of the film are the comments by Barney Frank who says that marches and demonstrations are largely a waste of time, and that the really effective political players such as the NRA and the AARP never bother with walk ins, sit-ins, shoot-ins or shuffles. In the interview with Jesse Jackson, Hoffman is too flustered to ask all of his questions.",
